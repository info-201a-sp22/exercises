#  Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands. You will navigate through your files and eventually do some basic text analysis with a Presidential Inaugural Address.

Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks:


-  Navigate to your "Desktop" directory

-  Create a new folder called "quick-exercise"

-  Navigate into the "quick-exercise" folder you just created

-  Go this [website of Presidential Inaugural Addresses](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-guidebook/inaugural-addresses), and choose an address to use for this exercise. Next, using a text editor of your choice (i.e., a software application that allows you to create text documents like Atom, TextEdit, or Notepad), make a new file called "address.txt" and manually copy and paste the text of your Inaugural Address inside the text file. Be sure to save this file inside the "quick-exercise" folder that you made

-  Now, going back to your command line interface, list the contents of your "quick-exercise" folder to verify that the new file is there

-  Display the contents of the "constitution.txt" file in the terminal
    -  *Hint: Mac Users can use the `less` command to easily scroll up and down. Windows users can use the `more` command.*

-  Navigate to the "Documents" folder for your machine

-  Display the contents of the "Desktop/quick-exercise/address.txt" file in the terminal *without changing directories again!*

-  Bonus: search for a word in the Inaugural Address (try "tax," "freedom," and "america")
