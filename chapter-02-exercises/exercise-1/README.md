#  Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands.

Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks (no need to fork or download this repository):


-  Navigate to your "Documents" directory


-  Create a new folder called "quick-exercise"


-  Navigate into the "quick-exercise" folder you just created


-  Using the text editor of your choice (e.g., Atom, TextEdit, ), create a new (empty) file called "constitution.txt" inside the "quick-exercise" folder that you made


-  List the contents of the folder to verify the new file is there


-  Search online for the text of the US Constitution (here's one https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/full-text), then copy and paste the text into the "constitution.txt" file you created. Save your changes through the editor


-  Display the contents of the "constitution.txt" file in the terminal
    -  *Hint: Mac Users can use the `less` command to easily scroll up and down. Windows users can use the `more` command.*

-  Navigate to the "Desktop" folder for your machine

-  Display the contents of the "Documents/quick-exercise/constitution.txt" file in the terminal *without changing directories again!*

-  Bonus: search for a word in the US Constituion (try "tax," "freedom," and "america")
