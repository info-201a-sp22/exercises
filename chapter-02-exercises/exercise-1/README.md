#  Exercise 1
This exercise is a brief review of terminal commands. You will navigate through your files and eventually do some basic text analysis with a text from Project Gutenberg.

Open up your command-line terminal, and perform the following tasks:


1.  First, navigate to your "Desktop" directory from the command line

2.  Then, create a new folder called "quick-exercise"

3.  Navigate into the "quick-exercise" folder you just created

4.  Go to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads). Browse through the available texts and pick one — preferably a text that you've read before or that you have some interest in. Click on the text and then click on "Plain Text UTF-8." Now download that plain text file via the URL. Rename the file something more coherent and readable (if using Windows, you may have already renamed it). If you have trouble, you can also save this file manually, but be sure to save this file inside the "quick-exercise" folder

5.  Now, going back to your command line interface, list the contents of your "quick-exercise" folder to verify that the new file is there

6.  Display the contents of your text file in the terminal
    -  *Hint: Mac Users can use the `less` command to easily scroll up and down. Windows users can use the `more` command.*
    
✨ Bonus: search for a word in your text file! ✨

7.  Now for something a little harder... navigate to your "Documents" folder

8.  Display the contents of your text file again, but this time *without changing directories* (this will require that you understand the relationship between your Desktop folder and your Documents folder!)
