# Exercise 1
In this exercise, you will practice using git to clone and edit repositories, as will be required for later exercises.

1. If you haven't already, configure your name and email address for your GitHub account using the terminal.

2. If you haven't already, create your own version of this repository on GitHub by using the link to using GitHub Classroom.

3. Using the terminal, clone **your version** of the repository to your computer (make sure you're in the desired directory on your terminal).

4. On your machine, open up this file (`exercise-1/README.md`) in Atom or a text editor of your choice.

5. In the `README.md` file, below these instructions, add an h1 header "Favorite Foods" and an ordered list of your 3 favorite foods.

6. Using your terminal, add and commit the changes that you've made to your repository

7. Push the changes to GitHub, and then view them in your web browser. Make sure you are looking at the repository under _your_ account!
